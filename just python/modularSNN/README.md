# A Python Module for Building Multi-Layered SNNs
This is a module for building biologically-inspired self-organized spiking neural networks according to the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06902
* snn.py: Module
* snn_example.ipynb: Example network using the module

In the future, additional learning rules and neuron types can be added.
